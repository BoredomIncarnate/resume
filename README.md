Resume - Kyle Young 
======================

This repository is used to contain my resume and the workflow I use to create it.

This repository is based on [Leland Batey's resume repository](https://github.com/lelandbatey/resume/) and [Adam Ryman's resume repository](https://github.com/adamryman/resume).

My resume is written in Markdown, then compiled to pdf and html using Pandoc. The html version is created directly from the Markdown, while the pdf version is generated by first translating the Markdown to LaTex, then compiling that LaTex into a pdf using `pdflatex`.

## Requirements and Dependencies

This workflow assumes it is on the Linux platform. Additionally, this workflow requires the following tools:

- `pandoc`
- `texlive`
- The `titlesec` Tex package: `tlmgr install titlesec`
- The `multicol` Tex package
- The `enumitem` Tex package

## Building

To build, run `make` in this directory. The output files will be in the newly created `build/` directory.
